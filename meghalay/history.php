			The political history of Assam is well-known since the first millennium AD when political institutions began to take shape like that of greater northern India. The Brahmaputra valley housed several kingdoms and political territories while the valley’s southern and eastern hills experimented with numerous political cultures. It was only in the early 20th century that British historians like Edward Gait or Assamese historians like Kanaklal Barua began to write about this political past. Since then there has been a clear picture of the political cultures of Assam.
